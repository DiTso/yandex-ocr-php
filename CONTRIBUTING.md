# Discovered a bug?

**Step 1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/errogaht/yandex-ocr-php).** Please include:
- (A) what you did
- (B) what you expected to happen
- (C) what happened
- (D) what have you already tried to fix it?

**Step 2. Submit a PR.** 
If you have a solution for it and want to help, you can submit a Pull Request.

If you've never submitted a PR before, don't worry, it's not that difficult. Read [this tutoral](https://mattstauffer.co/blog/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-github-project-using-your-own-fork) and the rules above. I promise, you'll enjoy sending PRs after a while :-)
